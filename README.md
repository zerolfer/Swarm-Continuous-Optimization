# Swarm Continuous Optimization

A Swarm Intelligence-based system for uniobjective bidimensional continuous optimization.


## Aim of the project
This project is used as final project to the course "Intelligent Agents and Multiagent Systems" of the 
[Master's in AI (MUIA)](http://www.dia.fi.upm.es/masteria/?q=es/MUIA) offered by 
[The Technical University of Madrid (UPM)](http://www.upm.es/) for June 2019.


## Modules
The project is divided in 3 different modules each one used for a different function during the development of the project:


### Main module.
Built in Java JDK 8. Created upon the multiagent simulation java library [MASON](https://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason/).
I also use Maven Framework to the libraries managing.

Is used as the main source of the project, all the analysis documented in the _Paper module_ are done over this one.


### Plot3D module 
Built in Python used to plot and acquire the images of the 3D graphs.

Uses the Python's library `matplotlib` to plotting.


### Paper module
Written in LaTeX. It documents some important analysis carried out on the _Main module_ and collects all results of the behavior 
of the system in different environments.

It's written following the guidelines and style for papers published in Springerâ€™s Lecture Notes in Computer Science Series
(LNCS).


## Acknowledgments
This work is based on the studies of Qirong Tang, Fangchao Yu, Yuan Zhang, Lu Ding, and Peter Eberhard in 
their Springer's publication "A Stigmergy Based Search Method for Swarm Robots".

Thanks also to Nik Swoboda, teacher of the Master's, for his ideas to continue the project.
